### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

#### Sebastian Zajac earned his PhD in Theoretical Physics at the University of Silesia in Katowice. He is currently a theoretical physicist, an assistant professor at the Decision Analysis and Support Unit at SGH Warsaw School of Economics (Poland). The focus of his research are: outliers detection methods in grphs and time series, Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning, streaming data analysis, mathematical physics. His latest [publications](https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=Ttb9GbAAAAAJ&hl=pl) center around feature selection methods in predictive and credit scoring models. At present he works also as a MLops in the polish bank.
